        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>
          A Programmer and Data Scientist from the United States who works on AI-related projects such as chatbots or reading behavioral patterns.
          My goal is to continuously expand my expertise in software development and data science, with a focus on AI and automation. I aim to develop innovative solutions that push the boundaries of what’s possible, from building smarter systems to solving complex, real-world problems through technology. Ultimately, I want to create impactful tools that not only streamline processes but also improve how people interact with data and technology. As I grow professionally, I hope to collaborate with forward-thinking teams and contribute to projects that shape the future of tech.
